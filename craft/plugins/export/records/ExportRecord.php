/**
 * Export plugin for Craft CMS
 *
 * Export Record
 *
 * --snip--
 * Active record models (or “records”) are like models, except with a database-facing layer built on top. On top of
 * all the things that models can do, records can:
 *
 * - Define database table schemas
 * - Represent rows in the database
 * - Find, alter, and delete rows
 *
 * Note: Records’ ability to modify the database means that they should never be used to transport data throughout
 * the system. Their instances should be contained to services only, so that services remain the one and only place
 * where system state changes ever occur.
 *
 * When a plugin is installed, Craft will look for any records provided by the plugin, and automatically create the
 * database tables for them.
